=== IRSSI THEME: Voon
=====================

This is my attempt at making irssi look as pretty as some of the other IRC
clients available on Mac these days (specifically Textual, Limechat).

There's a method to the design, primarily important things taking place around
the conversation are prefixed with '==' and colored in a fancy way to highlight
what action has taken place. Also separators between 'nicks' and 'comments' are
used to distinguish actions. These are more subtle but fit to allow the user to
glance at an action and immediately recognize what's taken place.

I am a long ways from finishing the formatting. I spent one 2 hour period
getting this far and have done little since. Though publishing this is a bit
more motivation to get some important formats finished (namely highlighting when
someone messages the user and privmesgs).
